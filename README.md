Collection of lousy circuits for learning purpose.

I've been trying to build a brainfuck CPU from the ground up, memory, display, counter and all. But performance limitations do not allow for the millions gates required.
Instead, the current BF CPU uses built-in parts, including the console output.

The custom RGB display, designed to show the output of mandelbrot.b, works, but the naive BF CPU is too slow to be practical in that case, so an optimizing CPU is being built.

= Might be of interest =
- bf_cpu_module_w_console.dig
- bf_cpu_module_w_custom_rgb.dig

Remember to set the BF program in Digital > Edit > Circuit specific settings > Advanced > Program file
